# What even is this?
These are a few programs written in Not eXactly C, a high level C based language that can be used to program the LEGO Mindstorms NXT 2.0 brick without any firmware alterations. Most of the programs are a work in progress, please do not expect them to be perfect.

# How do I run this on my NXT?
Install the Fantom USB driver (included with the Mindstorms software), install Bricx Command Center (http://sourceforge.net/projects/bricxcc/files/bricxcc/), open the NXC source, compile, download to brick, and run.
